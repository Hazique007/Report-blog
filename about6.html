            <p class="tsmall2">

                Agriculture has been an essential part of human civilization for thousands of years,
                providing food, fiber, and other resources for human consumption and economic
                development. Over time, advancements in technology have played a significant role
                in the evolution of agriculture, from the domestication of plants and animals to the
                use of mechanized tools and techniques in farming practices. In recent years, modern
                technologies have revolutionized the field of agriculture, enabling farmers to
                increase efficiency, productivity, and sustainability while producing high-quality and
                safe food (Rehman et al., 2016).<br><br>
                According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
                Nations, the world's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which will
                increase the demand for food by 70%. This demand can be met only through the
                adoption of modern technologies in agriculture, which can increase crop yields, reduce
                waste, and improve food quality and safety. Furthermore, modern technologies can
                help farmers adapt to the challenges posed by climate change, water scarcity, and soil
                degradation, which threaten the sustainability of agriculture.<br><br>
                Sensors have become ubiquitous in various fields, from measuring bodily parameters
                to enabling automated driving. They play a crucial role in detecting and analysing
                information in modern applications of science, engineering, and technology,
                particularly those involving computer vision. One area where smart sensors are
                increasingly employed is the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves wireless
                networks and distributed sensors that collect and analyse real-time data to produce
                desired outcomes through appropriate processing.

                Sensors have become ubiquitous in various fields, from measuring bodily
                parameters to enabling automated driving. They play a crucial role in detecting and
                analysing information in modern applications of science, engineering, and technology,
                particularly those involving computer vision. One area where smart sensors are
                increasingly employed is the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves wireless
                networks and distributed sensors that collect and analyse real-time data to produce
                desired outcomes through appropriate processing. Communications technology has
                evolved rapidly in India and made smart farming a possibility. Sensors are now being
                used in agriculture to provide data to farmers to monitor and optimize crops given the
                environmental conditions and challenges.<br><br>

            <div class="tsmall2">
                In agriculture, we use various types of sensors such as:-<br><br>
                <b>1. Electronic nose sensors:-</b>
                Electronic nose sensors are becoming increasingly important in agriculture
                as they offer a fast, reliable, and non-destructive way to detect plant diseases, monitor
                soil health, and identify insect infestations. By analysing the volatile organic
                compounds (VOCs) released by plants, electronic noses can provide farmers with
                valuable information about the health of their crops and soil. In crop disease detection,
                e-noses can identify the specific VOC profile associated with a diseased plant, allowing
                for early detection and treatment to prevent the spread of the disease. In soil
                monitoring, electronic noses can detect changes in the soil VOC profile, which can
                indicate changes in the soil microbial community, nutrient levels, and overall soil
                health. This information can help farmers to adjust their farming practices to optimize
                crop yields and minimize the use of fertilizers and pesticides.<br><br>

                <b>2. Electrochemical sensors:-</b>
                Electrochemical sensors are increasingly being used in agriculture for a range
                of applications, including soil monitoring, plant health assessment, and food quality
                control. These sensors work by detecting and measuring chemical compounds and
                reactions using electrochemical methods.
                In soil monitoring, electrochemical sensors can measure parameters such as soil
                moisture, pH, and nutrient levels, allowing farmers to optimize irrigation and
                fertilization. These sensors can also detect the presence of pollutants in the soil,
                such as heavy metals, pesticides, and herbicides, which can have harmful effects on
                plant growth and human health.

            <p class="tsmall2">






                Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly being used
                in agriculture for a variety of purposes. They can be equipped with various sensors and
                cameras to capture images and data from crops, soil, and livestock. One of the
                primary uses of drones in agriculture is for crop monitoring and mapping. Drones
                equipped with cameras and sensors can provide high-resolution images and data
                on crop health, growth rates, and nutrient levels. This information can be used by
                farmers to optimize their crop management practices, reduce input costs, and increase
                yields (Ahirwar et al., 2019).
                Applications of Drone- <br><br>

            <p class="tsmall2">





                Global Positioning System (GPS) has revolutionized the agriculture industry
                by providing accurate and real-time information for precision farming. With GPS
                technology, farmers can map their fields, track equipment, monitor crop growth, and
                optimize yield. GPS can help farmers create precise maps of their fields, allowing
                them to identify areas that require different treatments, such as fertilizers or
                pesticides. By using GPS data, farmers can optimize their use of resources, reduce
                waste, and improve crop yields. In addition, GPS technology can help farmers track
                their equipment, such as tractors and harvesters, in real-time. This allows them to
                better manage their equipment, reduce downtime, and improve efficiency. GPS can
                also be used to monitor crop growth and predict yields. By collecting data on soil
                moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors, farmers can optimize
                irrigation and fertilization schedules, resulting in healthier plants and better yields
                (Yousefi and Razdari, 2015).

                Modern technologies have significantly impacted the agricultural industry,
                providing new opportunities for increased efficiency, sustainability, and productivity.
                With the help of automation and robotics, farmers can accomplish their tasks
                with greater precision, speed, and accuracy, while reducing labour costs and risks.
                Biotechnology, precision farming, and data analytics have also played a vital role in
                shaping modern agriculture, enabling farmers to optimize their production by
                enhancing crop yields, improving disease and pest management, and reducing waste.
                Cloud computing and IoT have provided farmers with easy access to real-time data,
                enabling them to make better decisions, while reducing costs and increasing
                profitability. <br><br>
                Overall, the integration of modern technologies in agriculture has helped to address
                many of the challenges facing the industry, and it is expected to continue to drive
                innovation and growth in the future. <br><br>
                The world population is slated to grow to about 9 billion by 2050. The challenge is to
                find ways and means to produce enough to feed it. The challenge of reducing acreage
                under agriculture and food wastage in production and distribution is having a major
                impact on the world. The increasing role of technology in agriculture to address these
                issues is the only way forward to a food-secure future. Technology can help save
                foreign exchange for countries, increase productivity, and lead to an improvement in
                the overall standard of farmer communities. India has a long way to go in the adoption
                of modern farming practices through technology. The pace is slow and path-breaking
                efforts need to be made to educate farmers about the benefits to be had with
                technology. Transcending the barriers of archaic farming practices and medieval
                mindsets is a challenge that needs to be overcome for a better tomorrow. Technology
                in agriculture has the potential to truly lead India to be “Atmanirbhar Bharat” in all
                respects, and be less dependent on extraneous factors.
