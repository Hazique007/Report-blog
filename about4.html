                Hydrogen has surfaced as a viable solution to the global energy
                and environmental problems in an era characterized by urgent
                worries about climate change and the necessity of moving away
                from fossil fuels and hence providing sustainable alternative(s).
                The purpose of this study article is to thoroughly investigate
                hydrogen's potential as the fuel of the future. This paper will
                explore the production of energy by the hydrogen fuel in two
                main ways of production, hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen
                combustion. Considering both the financial and environmental
                viability of it. We hope that this thorough analysis will add to the
                continuing conversation on the critical role hydrogen may play in
                our energy transition.

            <span class="heading ">Introduction</span><br><br><br>
            <p class="tsmall2">

                The main features of a fuel cell are shown in Figure1, and Figure 2 shows the working of a fuel cell.
                The figure includes a fuel electrode on anode, air electrode on cathode as oxidant and an electrolyte.
                The
                fuel and oxidizing agents are fed through the electrodes and are brought into contact with the
                electrolyte.
                Reaction between the oxidizing agent and fuel produces voltage at the electrodes. The positive terminal
                of
                the cell is the oxygen electrode, and the negative terminal of the battery is the fuel. The electrons
                with
                other ions are conducted through the electrolyte and travels from one electrode to another, completing
                the
                electrical circuit to satisfy the connected external load. The fuel cell continues to operate as the
                current
                flows through the load and the reactants (fuel and oxidant) are fed. The electromotive force (emf) of
                the
                fuel cell is in the order of 1V. In series, many cells are connected to provide a terminal voltage which
                is
                known as ‘module.' Depending on the mode of operation, a fuel cell battery constitutes several modules
                connected either in series or parallel. <br><br>
                The Gibbs free energy change, accompanying the oxidation of the fuel at the absolute temperature relates
                to the corresponding enthalpy and entropy changes given in equation 1. <br><br>
                <span class="centeralign">∆G = ∆H - T∆S</span> <br><br>
                The ∆G determines the maximum emf of the cell in terms of equation 2.<br><br><br>

            <span class="big">The basics of fuel cells can be explained using the hydrogen-oxygen cell. Two electrodes
                consisting of
                platinum foil submerged in an electrolyte (potassium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solution). Hydrogen gas
                is delivered into the fuel cell's anode, where it dissociates in the presence of a catalyst to generate
                H+ ions
                and electrons before moving on to the electrolyte. Oxygen gas is introduced to the cathode, where it
                picks
                up electrons and combines with the water in the electrolyte (potassium hydroxide KOH solution) to
                produce hydroxyl ions (OH-). The OH- and H+ ions in the electrolyte are in balance with the water
                (H2O). A DC power of 100 to 200 mA/cm2 is applied in at a voltage of roughly 1V, usually on the
                electrical output of a single cell. Equation 3 states that the hydrogen electrode takes the place of the
                total
                reactions of hydrogen ions consumed at the oxygen electrode.<br><br>

                In Hydrogen Combustion, Hydrogen (H2) is burned (combustion i.e. reaction with oxygen) which due
                to the combustion reaction gives out thermal energy as is given in
                combustion engines, in this reaction a mixture of H2 and air is
                combusted in a combustion chamber either with compression
                ignition method or spark ignition, the latter is more preferred as
                hydrogen has very high self-combustion temperature which
                requires very high compression ratios, whereas the ignition
                energy is very low so it makes it easily combustible by spark
                ignition method, this thermal energy obtained in combustion is
                further converted to a suitable form of energy preferably
                mechanical like in automobile engines the energy output reaction can simply be given as :<br><br>

                2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>
                It does also have its own benefits such as it is clean burning, the primary combustion product is water
                without CO2, but some NOx is there in hydrogen combustion

            <span class="heading "> Why Hydrogen as a fuel?
            </span><br><br><br>


            <p class="tsmall2">
                The volume, cost, availability, transportability, and storage ability all influence the choice of fuel.
                Hydrogen is the most significant fuel since it produces more energy when combined with oxygen than
                when used alone. The costliest fuel is hydrogen, and storing it safely and effectively is a challenge.
                Almost all common fuels, including methane, butene, toluene, ethane, benzene, butane, kerosene, decane,
                octane, and many more, contain hydrogen as a chemical component (also known as a hydrocarbon). Also,
                the calorific value of Hydrogen is about three times as that of petroleum and diesel, the calorific
                value of
                some fuels is given in the table below:

            <span class="heading ">Why to use Hydrogen and Oxygen Fuel Cells?
            </span><br><br><br>

            <p class="tsmall2">

                When compared to traditional fossil fuels, the fuel cell offers many advantages but fewer
                disadvantages. <br>Here are some advantages and disadvantages:<br><br>
                <b>1. High Efficiency</b><br>
                <b>2. Low thermal emission</b><br>
                <b>3. Good fuel flexibility</b><br>
                <b>4. Non-polluting</b><br>
                <b>5. Low maintenance cost</b><br>
                <b>6. Low chemical emission</b><br><br>
                Based on lower heating value (LHV), fuel cell effectiveness ranges from 45 to 55%, and in a hybrid
                system, it reaches 70%. Although the fuel cell is more efficient at half load, it is still quite
                efficient at
                peak load. Because there are only two moving parts in a fuel cell—the cooling system and the fuel—the
                noise level is likewise lower.<br><br>
                Two drawbacks exist, namely.<br>
                1. The cost for the stationary electric generation is too high<br>
                2. The hydrogen used in the fuel cell is quite expensive and its storage requires energy expenditure

            <span class="heading "> Types of Hydrogen-Oxygen fuel cells
            </span><br><br><br>
            <p class="tsmall2">

                Based on the combination of fuel, oxidizer, and electrolyte, as well as the operating temperature and
                pressure, there are numerous varieties of fuel cells. Regenerative, direct, and indirect fuel cells are
                further
                categories for fuel cells. Direct fuel cells require a low temperature in order to function. Low
                temperature
                direct fuel cells include hydrogen-halogen, metal-oxygen, hydrogen-oxygen, and organic compound
                oxygen fuel cells. Ammonia-oxygen, hydrogen-oxygen, and organic compound-oxygen fuel cells are
                included in the category of medium temperature fuel cells. Hydrogen-oxygen and carbon-monoxide fuel
                cells are included in the high temperature group. The direct fuel cell class includes these three
                temperature-based fuel cells. Reformer and biochemical fuel cells are classified as indirect fuel cells;
                on
                the other hand, as figure 3 illustrates, chemical, radioactive, electrical, photochemical, and thermal
                fuel
                cells are a component of regenerative fuel cells. The most logical approach seems to be the
                classification
                based on the reactant states of aggregation. This approach makes the most obvious distinction between
                construction and operating approaches.<br><br>
                <I>4.1 Gaseous Fuel Cell:</I> The liquid and gaseous oxidizing agents that are utilized in the new
                subdivision
                of
                gaseous fuel cells are categorized based on these factors. Liquid oxidizing agent: Equation 4 indicates
                the
                presence of a bromine, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine solution in this oxidizing agent.<br><br>
                H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>→ H<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>
                <I>4.2 Gaseous oxidizing agent:</I> Air, a mixture of numerous other gasses, oxygen, chlorine, and other
                solutions are utilized as fuel in this oxidizing agent. Equation 5 describes the electrochemical
                reaction as
                follows:<br><br>
                H<sub>2 </sub>+ ½ O<sub>2 </sub>→ H<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>

                <I>4.3 Liquid Fuel Cell:</I> One benefit of a liquid fuel cell is its easy solubility in the electrolyte
                due to
                the
                presence of liquid oxidant, or H2O2. Direct fuel cells are those that use liquid or gaseous fuel as
                their fuel
                source. The most popular and advanced type of direct fuel cell is the hydrogen-oxygen cell. The
                "hydrazine cell" is said to be the top performer in the liquid fuel cell category out of all the direct
                fuel
                cells that are now on the market. Equation 6 below depicts the chemical reaction that occurs inside a
                liquid fuel cell.<br><br>
                CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 3H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>→ CO<sub>2</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O<br><br>

                <I>4.4 Solid Fuel Cell:</I> Direct hydrocarbon fuel cells are less developed in this category, although
                they
                are
                still more efficient than other traditional fuels used in internal combustion engines. The expensive
                cost of
                this cell is a drawback, though. According to equation 7, the related chemical reaction that occurs in
                this
                solid fuel cell is as follows:<br><br>
                C + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub><br><br>
                The fuel cell based on the classification of electrolyte or temperature:<br><br>
                1. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC)<br>
                2. Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC)<br>
                3. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)<br>
                4. Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC)<br>
                5. Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC)<br>

                <span class="heading ">Combustive properties of Hydrogen
                </span><br><br><br>
            <p class="tsmall2">

                The following properties of Hydrogen contribute to its use as a combustible fuel:<br><br>
                <I>5.1 Wide range of Flammability:</I><br><br>
                Hydrogen possesses a broader flammability range compared to other fuels, allowing it to be burned in
                an internal combustion engine across a wide spectrum of fuel-air mixtures. One notable benefit is
                hydrogen's ability to operate on a lean mixture, which contains less fuel than the theoretical,
                stoichiometric, or chemically ideal amount required for combustion with a given amount of air. This
                characteristic facilitates the ease of starting an engine on hydrogen. Typically, running a vehicle on a

                lean mixture enhances fuel economy and results in a more complete combustion reaction. Moreover,
                the final combustion temperature tends to be lower, which diminishes the emission of pollutants like
                nitrogen oxides in the exhaust. However, there's a threshold to the leanness of the engine's operation,
                as excessively lean mixtures can markedly decrease power output by reducing the volumetric heating
                value of the air/fuel mixture.<br><br>

                <I> 5.2 Small Quenching Distance:</I><br><br>
                Hydrogen possesses a shorter quenching distance compared to
                gasoline, which means hydrogen flames travel nearer to the cylinder walls before extinguishing. As a
                result, quenching a hydrogen flame is more challenging than a gasoline flame. This reduced
                quenching distance may also heighten the risk of backfire, as flames from a hydrogen-air mixture can
                pass through a nearly closed intake valve more easily than those from a hydrocarbon-air mixture.<br><br>

                <I>5.3 High Auto-ignition temperature:</I><br><br>
                Hydrogen possesses a relatively high
                autoignition temperature, which
                significantly impacts the compression of
                a hydrogen-air mixture. The autoignition
                temperature is a crucial determinant of
                the feasible compression ratio for an
                engine, as the temperature increase
                during compression correlates with this
                ratio. Exceeding hydrogen's autoignition
                temperature can lead to premature
                ignition, thereby capping the
                compression ratio. Hydrogen's elevated
                autoignition temperature permits the use
                of higher compression ratios in hydrogen
                engines compared to hydrocarbon
                engines, which is beneficial for thermal
                efficiency.
                The temperature rise is shown by the
                equation:<br><br>
            <div class="centre-image"><img src="./png/eq.png" width="200" height="120" style="align-content: center">
            </div>


            <span class="big">Where,<br>
                T1 = absolute initial temperature<br>
                T2 = absolute final temperature<br>
                γ = ratio of specific heats<br>
                V1 /V2 = the compression ratio<br><br>

                However, igniting hydrogen in a compression ignition or diesel engine is challenging due to the
                high temperatures required for ignition. The autoignition temperature, the lowest temperature needed
                to start self-sustained combustion in a fuel mixture without external ignition, is notably high for
                hydrogen at 585ºC. This makes igniting a hydrogen-air mixture with heat alone difficult, necessitating
                an additional ignition source.<br><br>
                Autoignition temperatures for various fuels, which have significant implications for the compression
                of hydrogen-air mixtures, are listed in Table 2, influencing the maximum compression ratio an engine
                can utilize, as it is tied to the temperature increase during compression.<br><br>

                <I>5.4 High Flame Speed:</I><br><br> Hydrogen exhibits a high flame speed at stoichiometric ratios. In
                such
                conditions, its flame speed is almost an order of magnitude greater than gasoline's, allowing hydrogen
                engines to more closely mimic the ideal thermodynamic cycle. However, at leaner mixtures, the flame
                speed significantly reduces. Both flame velocity and adiabatic flame temperature are crucial for
                engine operation and control, affecting thermal efficiency, combustion stability, and emissions. The
                relationship between laminar flame velocity and flame temperature can be graphically represented as
                a function of the equivalence ratio.<br><br>

                <I>5.5 High Diffusivity:</I><br><br> Hydrogen possesses a high diffusivity, allowing it to disperse in
                the air much
                more effectively than gasoline. This characteristic is beneficial for two primary reasons. First, it
                aids
                in creating a uniform mixture of fuel and air. Second, in the event of a hydrogen leak, the gas
                disperses quickly, which can prevent or reduce the risk of unsafe conditions.<br><br>

                <I>5.6 Low Density:</I><br><br> Hydrogen's low density presents two significant challenges for its use
                in internal
                combustion engines. First, a substantial volume is required to store sufficient hydrogen for an
                acceptable driving range. Second, the energy density of a hydrogen-air mixture is lower, which
                diminishes the power output.<br><br>
                <I>5.7 Minimum ignition source energy:</I><br><br> The minimum ignition source energy is the lowest
                energy
                needed to ignite a fuel-air mixture with an ignition source, such as a spark discharge. For a hydrogen
                air mixture, it is 0.02 mJ, in contrast to 0.24 mJ for a petrol-air mixture, and remains roughly
                constant
                across the flammability range. The hydrogen-air mix's low minimum ignition energy signifies that a
                much weaker spark is sufficient for ignition. Consequently, combustion can be initiated with a basic
                glow plug or resistance hot-wire, ensuring quick ignition of the charge in the combustion
                chamber.</span>

            <p class="tsmall2">



                <I>6.1 Hydrogen use in diesel engines:</I> Utilizing hydrogen as a supplementary fuel alongside diesel
                in
                internal combustion (IC) compression ignition (CI) engines offers several benefits. Primarily, it
                enhances the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio of the fuel mix. Additionally, the introduction of
                small quantities of hydrogen into a diesel engine can reduce the heterogeneity of the diesel fuel
                spray. This is due to hydrogen's high diffusivity, which promotes a more homogenous and well
                premixed combustible mixture with air. Consequently, this can potentially eliminate the formation
                of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide during combustion, although trace
                amounts might still be produced from the incomplete combustion of lubricating oil within the
                combustion chamber. However, hydrogen alone cannot serve as the exclusive fuel in a CI engine
                because the compression temperature is insufficient to ignite the hydrogen, given its higher self
                ignition temperature. Therefore, without the aid of a spark plug or glow plug, hydrogen is not a
                viable sole fuel option for diesel engines.<br><br>

                <I> 6.2 Hydrogen use in spark ignition (SI) engines:</I> Hydrogen serves as a viable fuel option for
                internal
                combustion engines, akin to spark-ignited gasoline engines. Research on hydrogen (H2) as a fuel
                predominantly explores its use in spark-ignited engines. Hydrogen presents several advantageous
                properties for such applications, including low ignition energy, rapid flame propagation speed,
                and a broad operational range. When hydrogen is mixed with air, it forms a combustible mixture
                that can be ignited in a conventional spark ignition engine at an equivalence ratio that is below
                the lean flammability limit of a gasoline-air mixture. This ultra-lean combustion process yields
                low flame temperatures, resulting in reduced heat transfer to the engine walls, enhanced engine
                efficiency, and diminished NOx emissions in the exhaust.

                Hydrogen combustion engines and hydrogen fuel cells are two distinct methods of utilizing hydrogen
                as a fuel source. Hydrogen combustion engines operate similarly to traditional internal combustion
                engines, burning hydrogen in a combustion chamber to generate power for the vehicle. On the other hand,
                hydrogen fuel cells use a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, which
                then powers an electric motor.

                <I>8.1 Based on Principle:</I> Hydrogen combustion engines and hydrogen fuel cells are two distinct

                cost-effective to run and more applicable to larger vehicles that require high fuel efficiency for
                long-distance driving. However, the adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles has been slowed due

            <span class="heading ">Conclusion </span><br><br><br>
            <p class="tsmall2">
                To make a decision, hydrogen fuel cells offer higher efficiency
                and are more environmentally friendly, but they are more complex
                and expensive to manufacture. Hydrogen combustion engines,
                while less efficient and producing emissions, are simpler, easier to
                manufacture, and have a longer range. The choice between the
                two technologies depends on the specific needs and goals of the
                application, as well as the availability and cost of hydrogen
                refueling infrastructure.<br><br>
                Hydrogen combustion engines, while less efficient, have the
                advantage of being relatively simple and easy to manufacture.
                They also have a longer range than hydrogen fuel cells and are
                more efficient than gasoline engines. However, they produce
                some emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), and the
                infrastructure for refueling hydrogen vehicles is not as well
                developed as that for gasoline or battery-electric vehicles. While
                hydrogen combustion produces emissions like nitrogen oxides, it
                is simpler to manufacture and offers a longer range than fuel cells.
                On the other hand, hydrogen fuel cells are more efficient,
                producing no emissions, but are complex and expensive to
                manufacture. Fuel cells require less hydrogen storage, making
                them more practical, especially for larger vehicles needing high
                fuel efficiency<br><br>
                Ultimately, the choice between the two technologies depends on
                factors like efficiency, emissions, cost, and infrastructure
                availability.
