                The most known altitude-compensating rocket nozzle to date is
                the aerospike nozzle, the origin of which dates back to Rocket
                dyne in the 1950s. This type of nozzle was specially designed to
                allow for better overall performance than conventional nozzle
                designs.<br><br>

            <div class="tsmall2">

                Aerospike nozzle design and development began in earnest in the early 1970s, with
                initiatives led by Rocket dyne, NASA, and the United States Air Force. The United States Air
                Force awarded Rocket dyne one of its first projects to design and test an annular aerospike
                thrust chamber, which was initially reported on in 1973 [25]. This study cites past contract
                work for aerospike thrust chamber testing at varied thrust levels, including first tests of a
                linear aerospike engine configuration that the author of this thesis could not discover in the
                open literature. In 1974, work<br><br>
                on the aerospike thrust chamber progressed, with the whole device being fabricated and
                tested [16]. Rocketdyne successfully tested a flight weight aerospike thrust chamber,
                establishing a technological baseline.<br><br>
                One of the first comprehensive investigations of the linear aerospike engine for SSTO and
                reusable applications was undertaken in 1977 by Rocketdyne [20]. They give the design and
                data for a dual-fuel, split combustor engine, as seen in Figure 9. Rocketdyne established that
                the linear aerospike engine was adaptable for a wide range of thrust levels by comparing it to
                the Space Shuttle Main Engine's materials technology. Figure 9: Rocketdyne's Linear
                Aerospike Nozzle Concept [20]. The aerospike technology was not thoroughly investigated
                again until the mid-1990s, when the Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment (LASRE) program was
                established to support Lockheed Martin's X-33 development.<br><br>
                NASA/ Lockheed Martin Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment (LASRE) In 1997, Rocketdyne,
                now a company of Boeing, announced the results of the Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment
                (LASRE) study, which demonstrated the performance of the linear aerospike on a lifting
                body to imitate the X-33 [24]. This was accomplished by putting a 20% scale X-33 forebody
                on an SR-71 (Lockheed Martin Blackbird) to assess the size of the slipstream effect at the
                appropriate altitude and Mach number conditions before beginning hot fire testing on the
                engine. The slipstream effect is the decrease of engine performance caused by the air
                passing over the lifting body interacting with the outer boundary of the exhaust plumes.<br><br>
                <b>Current Work </b> <br>
                Since the lack of progress linked with the LASRE and X-33 projects in 2001, there has been
                minimal funding committed to the linear aerospike engine's development. Furthermore, a
                lack of advances in materials science has slowed the development of SSTO technology.<br><br>

                A nozzle is a mechanical device with a variable cross section that regulates the flow of a
                fluid—either water or air—and its characteristics. They help the combustion gasses from
                burning propellants in rocket engines to expand and accelerate so that the exhaust gases may
                escape the nozzle at speeds close to or above supersonic and hypersonic<br><br>

            <div class="tsmall2">

                Types of nozzles<br><br>
                1. The cone<br>
                2. The bell or contoured<br>
                3. The annular or plug<br><br>

                <b>1. Conical nozzle:</b> Due to its simplicity and ease of manufacturing, the conical nozzle was
                widely utilized in early rocket applications. The walls of the cone diverge at a constant angle,
                hence the name. Because it optimizes the axial component of exit velocity and generates a
                high specific impulse, a measure of rocket efficiency, a narrow angle results in increased
                thrust. But the price is a heavier, longer nozzle that requires more construction work. On the
                other hand, a broad nozzle wall angle minimizes both size and weight. Sadly, because to
                overexpansion and flow separation brought on by the high ambient pressure, big angles
                degrade performance at low altitudes.<br><br>
                <b>2. Bell nozzle:</b> The most popular nozzle design, the bell, has several advantages over the
                conical nozzle in terms of size and functionality. Take note of the two components that make
                up the bell in the above figure. The nozzle diverges at a rather considerable angle close to the
                throat, but further downstream the degree of divergence tapers down. There is relatively little
                divergence angle near the nozzle exit. The bell, which reduces weight while increasing
                performance, is a compromise between the two extremes of the conical nozzle. The nozzle's
                contouring is the most crucial design element in order to minimize performance and prevent
                oblique shocks. But we have to keep in mind that the ideal bell shape will only exist at a
                single altitude.<br><br>
                <b>3. Annular nozzle:</b> Because of its increased complexity, the annular nozzle—also referred to
                as the plug or "altitude-compensating" nozzle—is the least used of the nozzles studied. The
                word "annular" describes the process of combustion as taking place around the base of the
                nozzle along a ring, or annulus. The term "plug" describes the center body that stops the flow
                from what would normally be the middle section of a nozzle. These nozzles are commonly
                referred to as "altitude-compensating" because that is its main benefit; this characteristic will
                be discussed in more detail later.<br><br>
                It is helpful to note some significant design parameter differences between annular nozzles
                and conical or bell nozzles before delving into the several varieties of annular nozzles. For a
                conventional nozzle, the expansion area ratio has previously been covered. It is also
                necessary to consider the area of the center body (A plug) while thinking about an annular
                nozzle.<br>
                <div class="centre-image"><img src="./png/for.png" width="500" height="300"
                        style="align-content: center">
                </div><br><br>

                Another parameter particular to this type of nozzle is the annular diameter ratio, D p / D t,
                or the ratio of the center body diameter to that of the throat. The ratio is used as a measure
                of the nozzle geometry for comparison with other plug nozzle shapes. Typical values of this
                ratio appear in the above figure.

            <p class="tsmall2">

                During World War 2, the revolution in aeronautical propulsion was considerably accelerated.
                NASA and other space research organizations were founded as a result of the need for faster,
                larger, and more efficient aerospace vehicles.
                Nozzles that function well in a variety of environmental working circumstances. The majority
                of nozzles are either very difficult to build, or they do not have this altitude compensating
                effect. These days, launch operations only employ bell nozzles. However, a significant
                disadvantage of these bell nozzles is that their efficiency decreases with altitude. This is
                caused by a phenomenon known as separation of the combustion gasses, which causes
                thrust loss in the nozzle at higher altitudes.<br><br>
                For conventional bell nozzles, loss mechanisms fall into three categories:<br><br>
                1.Geometric or divergence loss<br>
                2.Viscous drag loss<br>
                3.Chemical kinetics loss.<br><br>

                A radial component of momentum is produced when part of the nozzle exit flow is directed
                away from the nozzle axis, leading to geometric loss. The exit flow of an ideal nozzle has a
                constant Mach number and pressure, and it is entirely parallel to the nozzle axis. By figuring
                out how much momentum<br><br>
                The geometric efficiency is calculated by taking the actual nozzle exit flow and comparing it
                to the parallel, uniform flow condition. When the geometric efficiency by comparing the
                actual nozzle output flow to the parallel, uniform flow condition. Relatively good geometric
                efficiency can be achieved by carefully designing the nozzle wall. Reduced nozzle efficiency
                is the result of a drag force acting in the opposite direction of thrust, which is created at the
                nozzle wall by the effects of a viscous high-speed flow. The drag force is obtained by
                calculation of the momentum deficit in the wall boundary layer. This viscous drag efficiency
                is defined as:<br>

            </div>

            <div class="tsmall2">


                The third nozzle loss mechanism is due to finite-rate chemical kinetics. Ideally, the engine exhaust
                gas reaches chemical equilibrium at any point in the nozzle flow field, instantaneously adjusting to
                each new temperature and pressure condition. In real terms, however, the rapidly accelerating
                nozzle flow does not permit time for the gas to reach full chemical equilibrium.

                The overall nozzle efficiency is then given by the combined effects of geometric loss, viscous drag
                and chemical kinetics: ηkin= 0.99(approximate).

                Aerospike<br><br>
                The aerospike nozzle is essentially a bell nozzle with an inside-out nozzle profile. The
                direction of the combustion gas flow is inward and radially toward the nozzle axis. Flow
                problems in the annular aerospike nozzle from a radial distance away from the nozzle axis in
                an annulus with a diameter. The direction of flow is inward and radially toward the nozzle
                axis. This idea is in contrast to a bell nozzle, which broadens the flow along diverging nozzle
                walls away from the axis. The "cowl-lip," or outer border of the annulus, is the point where
                the nozzle expansion process begins in an aerospike. In a standard bell nozzle, flow
                expansion continues regardless of what the ambient pressure is, and the flow can continue
                to over-expand until it separates from the nozzle walls. The linear aerospike, spike consists
                of a tapered wedge-shaped plate, with exhaust exiting on either side at the "thick" end.<br><br>
                <b>1.3.1 working principle</b><br>
                A rocket nozzle directs all gases generated in the engine's combustion chamber and
                accelerated by the throat out of the nozzle. The aerospike engine's main feature is that as
                the launch vehicle ascends along its trajectory, the lowering ambient pressure allows the
                engine's effective nozzle area ratio to grow. An aerospike nozzle is also known as an
                altitude-compensating nozzle due to its unique design capacity to retain aerodynamic
                efficiency as altitude increases and therefore throughout the entire flight. At the outer cowl
                lip, the gas expands to atmospheric pressure quickly, causing significant expansion waves to
                propagate inward at an angle through the gas stream. At the location of the previous
                expansions. The wave intercepts the spike, and the gas pressure equals the atmospheric
                pressure. For the over expanded situation, the spike causes the gas to be directed outward,
                resulting in compression waves that develop and travel outward at an angle before
                reflecting off the jet boundary as expansion waves. The process then begins again. The
                aerospike has a series of small combustion chambers along the ramp that fire hot gases over
                the ramps outside surface, producing thrust in a spike-shaped plume, hence the name
                "aerospike.<br><br>

            <div class="left-image"><img src="./png/sp1.png" width="400" height="300" style="align-content: center">

            <br><br>

            <div class="tsmall2">


                The ramp forms the inner wall of the bell nozzle, with atmospheric pressure acting as the
                "invisible" outer wall. To generate the thrust force, the combustion gases race along the
                inner and outer walls (the ramp and air pressure, respectively).<br><br>
                <b>1.3.2. Flow around Aerospike Nozzle</b><br>
                The main advantage to the annular aerospike nozzle design (both full length and truncated
                spike) is its altitude compensation ability below or at its design altitude. More specifically,
                the aerospike will not suffer from the same overexpansion losses a bell nozzle suffers and
                can operate near optimally, giving the highest possible performance at every altitude up to
                its design altitude. Above the design altitude, the aerospike behaves much like a
                conventional bell nozzle. Figure below shows the exhaust flow along an aerospike at low
                altitudes, design altitude, and high altitudes for a full spike and a truncated spike. Multiple
                expansion and compression, or shock, waves are evident in the flow in Figure these waves
                lead to losses in thrust. The outer flow boundary of the aerospike is the atmosphere itself.
                Unique to aerospike engines operating at their design altitude, engine geometry at the
                throat determines the expansion ratio of the aerospike nozzle and thus the corresponding

                Since the cold flow is considered, the values of Specific Heat Ratio(γ=1.4), gas constant of
                exhaust(R=287) and chamber temperature (Ti=300K) are taken of the values of ideal gas. For

                Flow Rate(2Kg/S) and Nozzle Pressure Ratio (NPR=20) were considered as constant. Based
                on the value of Mass flow rate and ideal gas constant values, other basic design parameters
                were determined by 2D Isentropic Flow Equations.<br><br>

                <b>Basic Design Methods:</b><br><br>
                The design of spike contour of the aerospike nozzle is the most important step in the overall
                design of the nozzle, which varies according to the operating conditions and application.
                However, the design procedure, including the basic physics behind the spike design remains
                the same. The design of spike can be done using the following methods-<br><br>
                i.Rao’s method based on calculus of variation<br>
                ii.Simple approximate method<br>

                <b>Simple Approximation Method:</b><br><br>
                Here, Simple approximation method is chosen to design spike contour. The simple
                approximate method assumes a series of centered isentropic expansion waves occurring at
                cowl lip of the spike nozzle. Using this method, the annular spike contour for a given
                pressure ratio, area at throat, and ratio of specific heats can be determined.
                A brief description of this is given below:
                The expansion ratio is determined for the corresponding pressure ratio from the relation
                which specifies the variation between the two. Since the flow is assuming to be parallel to

                A summary of the different rocket configurations considered in this study is presented in
                Table 1. Cases 1 and 5 in Table 1 describe the linear aerospike and bell nozzle control cases,
                respectively. The nozzle type classification of constant, limited, or infinite describes the
                modeled nozzle behavior during flight. A constant nozzle area maintains its value
                throughout flight; a limited nozzle area indicates that the area changes at lower altitudes,
                but is then held constant when it reaches the value of the bell nozzle constant area; an
                infinite nozzle type describes a theoretical aerospike expansion where the nozzle exit area
                has no upper limit and continues to increase with altitude. These nozzle configurations were
                chosen to show the effects of a wide range of nozzle designs on SSTO launch vehicle
                performance, and were applied in combination with varying thrust and specific impulse
                values since increasing these rocket engine performance parameters also decreases PMF.
                An aerospike specific impulse and thrust were chosen based on Mitsubishi’s LE-7 engine
                series [23], and the bell nozzle specific impulse and thrust were based on Pratt & Whitney’s
                RL10A-4 engine [18].<br><br>
                <b>2.2 OPTIMIZATION TRAJECTORY PROFILES</b><br>
                Obtaining a successful rocket trajectory is simple with very little input; provided there is
                enough thrust and a high enough Isp, rockets may obtain escape velocity. However,
                optimizing the launch trajectory is complex. There are two primary ways to optimize a basic
                rocket trajectory to expend less fuel, lowering the PMF. The first is a gravity turn, where the
                rocket gradually becomes parallel to the Earth’s surface, as opposed to a launch profile that
                is straight up with the orbital turn occurring quickly near the target altitude. For this thesis,
                the target altitude was 750 kilometers. This gravity turn is accomplished by adding
                directional controls to the flight path to change the pitch of the rocket and allowing the
                gravity of the Earth to influence the flight path of the rocket. To optimize launch mass,
                launch vehicles are designed to be relatively weak in bending, shear, and torsion, which are
                induced by lifting surfaces. Heavy lift launch vehicles build up speed in a nearly vertical
                trajectory, so that quickly rise above the dense, lower layers of the atmosphere to reduce
                the lifting forces. The gravity turn then trades vertical for horizontal speed so that the rocket
                may reach orbital velocity at altitude [7]. The second launch trajectory optimization
                technique is to increase the flight time of the rocket to assist with increased efficiency of the
                gravity turn [37]. By increasing the amount of time, the engine burns, gravity has greater
                opportunity to assist with the turn, resulting in less fuel consumed to reach the same orbital
                velocity. All comparisons in Sections 4.1.2-4.1.4 were made using this optimizing approach.
                Another self-check for optimization is that the rocket reaches altitude on the opposite side
                of the earth from the launch location.<br><br>

                The two primary optimization techniques are evident in velocity and altitude trajectory
                profiles. For Case 6 (Table 1), Figure 24 and Figure 25 present the velocity trajectory profiles
                before and after the application of the two optimizations techniques, respectively. In these
                figures, the designation “VEL” indicates the total velocity, relative to the Earth’s rotational
                speed at sea level at the equator, “VELI” the absolute orbital velocity, and “VELRAD” the
                radial component of the velocity throughout flight. By initiating a gravity turn in the
                trajectory, the magnitude of the radial velocity component decreases from a sharp peak
                (Figure 24) at about 140 seconds into a more continuous hump for the transition from the
                primary burn to coasting (Figure 25). Furthermore, the overall and orbital velocity
                magnitudes at the end of the primary burn increase from Figure 24 to Figure 25 so that
                there is less velocity loss during coasting, meaning less fuel is consumed during the
                circularization burn in order to reach and maintain the orbital velocity required at altitude.
                The total velocity curve describes the rocket’s total velocity magnitude compared to Earth’s
                rotation (1,041 mph at sea level, equator). During the primary burn phase of the trajectory,
                the rocket accelerates continuously at a fast rate, increasing speed.<br><br>
                The total velocity curve does not start at zero because of the assigned starting condition of
                100 ft/s to avoid discontinuity. During the coasting phase, the velocity decreases at a slow
                rate until the engine is re-ignited for the circularization burn. The orbital velocity follows the
                general trend of the overall velocity, and is an important indicator of maintaining altitude.
                The difference in magnitude between the total and orbital velocities is a result of the
                different reference frames for each, relative to the rotation of the Earth. For every altitude,
                there is an associated orbital velocity required to continuously overcome gravity. The
                purpose of the circularization burn is to keep the rocket oriented correctly at the appropriate
                altitude and velocity. For the target altitude of 750 km, the absolute orbital velocity is 24,546
                ft/s. Finally, the radial velocity is an indicator of the relative position of the rocket trajectory
                to the surface of the Earth. Maintaining too high of a magnitude indicates a perpendicular
                direction to the Earth, and the closer to zero it approaches, the more parallel the trajectory.
                Because the target orbit was circular as opposed to elliptical, the radial velocity should
                maintain roughly a value of zero at orbit. As previously discussed, the general shape of the
                radial velocity during the primary burn is a hump with a maximum magnitude roughly 1% of
                the maximum overall velocity magnitude. By the end of the coasting phase, the rocket should
                be at the target altitude with a negligibly small radial velocity.<br><br><br>

                Both the velocity profile and the altitude profiles, shown in Figure, show an increase in total
                flight time to target altitude of about 500 seconds, with the addition of the gravity turn
                assist. Before optimization, the Figure 6 altitude profile has a slight dip in altitude at about
                80 seconds into the flight that is not seen in Figure 6, post optimization. This is an indicator
                that prior to optimization, the rocket experiences greater difficulty in overcoming gravity
                due to its more vertically severe flight path.<br><br><br>

            <div class="tsmall2">
                <div class="questions"> Question 1: What are altitude compensating nozzles?</div>
                Altitude compensating nozzles, such as the aerospike nozzle, are designed to maintain

                The development of aerospike nozzles started in the 1970s, with initiatives led by Rocketdyne,
                NASA, and the United States Air Force. Rocketdyne successfully tested a flight weight aerospike
                thrust chamber, establishing a technological baseline. Further investigations and tests were
                conducted in the 1990s, supporting the development of SSTO technology.<br><br>

                <div class="questions"> Question 4: How can rocket trajectory optimization reduce fuel consumption?
                </div>
                Rocket trajectory optimization techniques, such as gravity turns and increased flight time, can
                reduce fuel consumption by utilizing the Earth’s gravity to assist with the turn and maintaining
                the rocket’s velocity. This reduces the amount of fuel needed for the circularization burn
                required to reach and maintain the desired orbital velocity.
